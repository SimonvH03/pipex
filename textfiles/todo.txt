Error handling
	- find out what errors need to be displayed
	- probably make ft_printf_fd
	- free all arrays (settle for char * or fix sfree_array)
	- close all fds

Fd handling
	- Close all fds that are no longer used immediately
	- figure out if possible how to use 1 Pipe for more than two processes
